Hint

You are given an array of integers nums and an integer target.

Return the number of non-empty subsequences of nums such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal to target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,5,6,7], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 subsequences that satisfy the condition.
[3] -> Min value + max value <= target (3 + 3 <= 9)
[3,5] -> (3 + 5 <= 9)
[3,5,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
[3,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3,6,8], target = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 subsequences that satisfy the condition. (nums can have repeated numbers).
[3] , [3] , [3,3], [3,6] , [3,6] , [3,3,6]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,3,3,4,6,7], target = 12
Output: 61
Explanation: There are 63 non-empty subsequences, two of them do not satisfy the condition ([6,7], [7]).
Number of valid subsequences (63 - 2 = 61).

 

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    1 <= nums[i] <= 106
    1 <= target <= 106


    Algo
    1. Sort the array.

2. Precompute powers of 2:
   pow2[i] = 2^i % MOD

3. Initialize:
   left = 0
   right = n - 1
   ans = 0

4. While left <= right:
   - If nums[left] + nums[right] <= target:
       Add 2^(right - left) to answer
       Move left forward
   - Else:
       Move right backward

5. Return answer % MOD

Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Sorting takes O(n log n)
- Two pointer scan takes O(n)
- Precomputing powers takes O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)
- For storing powers of 2
